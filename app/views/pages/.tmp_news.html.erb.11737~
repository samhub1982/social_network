	<strong>Nerd Speak:</strong> I have completed the user model for the website. The 
	database is up and running with the user table. The passwords are 
	encrypted, hashed, and salted. I have set up a session manager that 
	will keep the user signed in until they physically sign out using a 
	cookie.<br><br>
	<strong>Normal People Speak:</strong> You can now sign up, sign in and sign out. You 
	will stay logged in until you click on sign out. Your password is 
	secure.<br><br>
	Next I will begin working on the status stream. After that, I think 
	I will work on user profiles.

	I have the skeleton layout fully implemented and uploaded to the web. 
	I will be running two seperate projects during the development of the site. 
	This one will be updated as I make more and more progress on the real site. 
	You will be able to come to this website until the actual launch to get 
	updates on my progress.
