	After A TON of debugging code... I have the status feed running as well 
	as the relationship model that I am attaching it to. Essentially, what 
	I have decided to do with that is allow you to choose if you want their 
	status updates in your status stream. I currently have it set up like 
	twitter where you "follow" the person. The reason why I have taken that 
	route is because there is a possibility that you may not want to read 
	someone's status updates. Either way, outside of that, there will be no 
	relationship model for the rest of the site. You will be able to go to anyone's 
	profile to view their info, status, pictures, etc...<br><br>
	Here's what I will be working on over the next couple of weeks:
	<ul>
		<li>Comments</li>
		<li>Profiles</li>
		<li>Private Messages</li>
		<li>... and slowly getting started on the daunting task of putting together a photo gallery</li>
	</ul><br><br>
	However, I think I will be taking a few days off of this. So far, I would estimate about 
	1500 lines of code have been written for this.

	<strong>Nerd Speak:</strong> I have completed the user model for the website. The 
	database is up and running with the user table. The passwords are 
	encrypted, hashed, and salted. I have set up a session manager that 
	will keep the user signed in until they physically sign out using a 
	cookie.<br><br>
	<strong>Normal People Speak:</strong> You can now sign up, sign in and sign out. You 
	will stay logged in until you click on sign out. Your password is 
	secure.<br><br>
	Next I will begin working on the status stream. After that, I think 
	I will work on user profiles.

	I have the skeleton layout fully implemented and uploaded to the web. 
	I will be running two seperate projects during the development of the site. 
	This one will be updated as I make more and more progress on the real site. 
	You will be able to come to this website until the actual launch to get 
	updates on my progress.
