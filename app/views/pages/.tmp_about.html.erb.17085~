		General Site Theory:
	</b><br>
	The total goal behind this website is to give you (my family) the means 
	to stay in touch and give updates through a more private means than currently 
	offered in sites like Facebook or Myspace. Because of the unique nature of 
	exclusivity the site will operate slightly differently than a public social 
	networking site. There will be no need to send friend requests. Once you are 
	a member of the website you will automatically be "friends" with all the other members. 
	The site is primarily being developed for my family. However, you can always 
	invite a friend to the website. The friend will be considered a guest and 
	will be subject to the rest of the family. It will be outlined in greater 
	detail upon the launch of the site via the Terms of Service but what this 
	really means is that I reserve the right to remove a friend's account at any 
	time for any reason. The reason will generally be that one (and it will only take 
	one) family member does not want that person to be a part of this site. The reason 
	behind this is that this site is in existence primarily for the family. Overall, 
	I am looking forward to the full launch of this website.

	<i>*This is extremely dependent on me being able to get the Developer SDKs. Plus, in 
	Apple's case (and possibly Microsoft's) I would also need to get the App approved by them 
	for you to be able to download and use. The SDK's can cost money as well as keeping it in their 
	App Store.</i>

<p>
	Keep in mind that these future features are not set in stone and may change 
	or completely disappear. With that being said, there may be new or different 
	ones that pop up along the way.
</p>
<p>
	This website is being developed for my family and their close friends. 
	It will be exclusive to those people.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any ideas <b>(ESPECIALLY A NAME FOR THE SITE)</b> that you would like to see implemented in the site 
	please let me know. I want to make this website as personalized to your wishes as possible.
